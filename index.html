    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>FarmTalk is an innovative hybrid solution addressing critical challenges in plant disease identification and remediation in agriculture. 
By combining YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, with GPT-3.5 integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), 
the system offers real-time disease detection from leaf images and provides reliable, context-specific remediation advice. 
This approach aims to overcome limitations of traditional methods and LLM hallucinations, potentially revolutionizing crop management and enhancing food security.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</b>
</p>
<p>
  FarmTalk aims to help farmers quickly identify plant diseases and provide them with effective treatment suggestions. 
  The primary goal is to reduce the time and effort required for disease identification and improve the accuracy of remediation strategies.</p>

<p>
<b>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Currently, farmers rely on manual inspections or lab tests for disease identification, which can be slow and often inaccurate. 
  Existing automated systems may not offer immediate advice on how to treat identified diseases, leading to delays in addressing issues that can harm crops.
<p>

<p>
<b>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</b>
</p>
<p>
  If successful, FarmTalk could significantly enhance agricultural productivity by enabling farmers to respond swiftly to plant diseases. 
  This could lead to reduced crop losses, improved food security, and more sustainable farming practices.

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</b>
</p>

<p>
  If successful, FarmTalk could significantly enhance agricultural productivity by enabling farmers to respond swiftly to plant diseases. 
  This could lead to reduced crop losses, improved food security, and more sustainable farming practices.
</p>

<p>
<b>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</b>
</p>

<p>
  The team anticipated challenges in gathering comprehensive datasets for training the models and integrating various system components. 
  After taking feedback from the proposal presentation, the team decided to build a real time demo to showcase the system's capabilities, which requires the team to come up with an iteractive
  and user-friendly interface.

User Query: what is wrong with the plant image? and how do i fix it?
<br>
Generated Prompt: The leaf in the appears to be affected by a fungal disease commonly known as rust. This type of fungal infection is caused by various species of fungi. 
The control measures are:

<ul>
  <li>Pruning and Sanitation: Remove and dispose of affected leaves and plant debris to reduce the spread of spores.</li>
  <li>Chemical Control: Apply fungicides if the infection is severe. Fungicides containing active ingredients like chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or sulfur can be effective. Follow label instructions for safe application.</li>
  <li>Improving Air Circulation: Avoid overcrowding plants, as rust thrives in high-humidity conditions. Better air circulation can reduce fungal growth.</li>
  <li>Watering Practices: Water the plant at the base rather than overhead to prevent leaf wetness, which promotes rust spore germination.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclustion and Future Work</h2>
<p>

  In conclusion, the FarmTalk project presents a promising approach to enhancing plant disease management by integrating real-time disease detection 
  with reliable remediation advice through a hybrid model that combines YOLOv8 and GPT-3.5 with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
  This solution addresses the limitations of traditional methods, offering farmers a tool that not only identifies plant diseases quickly but also provides 
  context-specific treatment recommendations, thereby improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability. Current limitation will include, limited disease coverage, as of now the model only covers 
  plants such as cotton, and corn. More datasets need to be collected to increase model database and capabilities. One potential harm/risk to society would be a over dependence on such tools
  to replace traditional on-site experiance and knowledge, which would not be desirable. This can be addressed by acknowledging that this is a tool to make things conveniant and expedite action 
  and not a replacement.
